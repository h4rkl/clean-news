Currently, sequels in games are a relatively poor player experience requiring separate builds that quite often have zero-to-little connection to the prior build and community. Play-and-own enables a better gaming experience by potentially bringing the player’s community engagement and experience into future franchise installments.</p><p>Some major providers are building elements of this new games infrastructure (such as Epic Online Services’ cross-progression feature), but player ownership is not prioritized. That can only happen with a focus on open-source/interoperable standards.</p><h2><strong>New games backend</strong></h2><p>Games backend online services need to be built on-chain from the start.

                "text": "<p>The Digital Asset Decentralized Exchange, or DADex, is a decentralized exchange specialized for in-game assets. Some examples of these of in-game specializations are integrations with games’ infrastructure for better UX in price discovery and significant improvement in cash out payments UX (for example, direct credits to a player’s credit card) compared to current blockchain games.</p><p>New forms and utilization of ownership are taking place in blockchain games within the Solana games ecosystem. The ability to trade is just the beginning. Utilization for access, augmentation of the item, lending/renting, and ownership are driving players to contribute in ways not seen before in games. Early data indicates that these factors are significantly driving up key performance metrics like monetization and D7/D30 retention.</p><h2><strong>Why is this best built on Solana?</strong></h2><p>The first principle of play-and-own is that players are at the center, with gameplay prioritized above all else. Consumers will ultimately judge blockchain games based on the gameplay. They have rightly come to expect seamless experiences and high quality graphics. Anything less than that and play-and-own games will join the legion of faded play-to-earn games.</p><p>Solana is designed and built with performance in mind. A blockchain protocol needs to provide sufficiently high speeds and consistently low fees to enable in-game asset swaps at scale. Layer 2 blockchains that use subnet and sharding technology are positioning themselves to be able to keep fees low enough, but still have similar TPS limits as other L1s and will hit bottlenecks as the games scale.</p><p>There are also significant trade offs with not building this on a global single shared state like Solana. The slow throughput would make the player experience untenable. Since most in-game asset swaps are driven by current game session player progression, once capacity is reached one would have to bifurcate a player base in a single game across subnets/side chains.</p><p>In the case of Paid UA in blockchain games and eventually Paid UA on-chain, it is still unclear if subnets or shards will have a significant negative effect on organic growth coming from Paid UA. Solana’s global single shared state results in organic growth when Paid UA is executed. Players from games and users of other products on Solana are much more seamlessly onboarded to your game.</p><p>We are seeing a new wave of blockchain games coming that aren't like earlier games — the player matters and so does the experience. These new games are an advancement from traditional online games we know and love. Players get rewarded for their efforts and can contribute in a meaningful way to the experience and intellectual property. It’s starting now, but there’s more to do on the infrastructure front to create this new reality.</p><p>This year is an exciting one for the blockchain games industry. See you all at GDC next week!</p><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p><sup style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;\"><strong><em>1.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Some questions may arise on what this could mean for companies that currently utilize centralized data for commercial purposes and if large games platforms and publishers would push back on this vision.
