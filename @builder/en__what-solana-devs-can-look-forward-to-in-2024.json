And despite a worldwide industry downturn, developers have stuck around the Solana ecosystem throughout 2023 and stayed busy building. Now, businesses and users are starting to take notice.</p><ul><li>There are currently <strong>2,500+ developers</strong> in the Solana ecosystem, according to the Solana Foundation‚Äôs <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/2023-state-of-solana-developer-ecosystem\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open source service</a> measuring developer activity.</li><li>The same report found that of those 2,500+ devs, <strong>52.5% are more senior developers with more than three years of experience.</strong></li><li>According to Messari‚Äôs State of Solana report, there was <strong>an average of 40.7m daily user transactions</strong> in Q4 2023, with <strong>a high of 405k daily unique fee payers.</strong></li><li>An <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/deep-dive-on-solana.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">external deep dive from Visa</a> found that ‚Äúlow and predictable costs helped drive payments efficiencies.‚Äù&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Developers from across the ecosystem and beyond have been working hard at building the foundations for the next generation of blockchain projects. The infrastructure is here, and devs have a lot to get excited about when it comes to new tooling.</p><p>Here‚Äôs just some of the things that developers can look forward to in the coming year.</p><h3>Token extensions</h3><p>The long wait is almost over! In early 2024, <a href=\"https://solana.com/solutions/token-extensions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">token extensions</a> will bring new features to make token creation on Solana more flexible.&nbsp;</p><p>Token extensions, which were built in collaboration with large institutions, bring functionality to the token program level, without having to use any third-party programs. This makes it much easier to build an open and customizable token program while maintaining compatibility. Some early token extensions you can look forward to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Confidential transfers:</strong> Enable confidential token transfers on transparent blockchains, with opt-in confidentiality and optional auditability.</li><li><strong>Transfer hooks:</strong> Invoke custom programs to control token transfers.</li><li><strong>Metadata pointer: </strong>Designate canonical sources of truth for token metadata, which could allow for authoritative verification of genuine metadata</li></ul><p>Combined with future runtime upgrades, the Solana ecosystem is building an open and customizable token platform.
