Valadez revealed in an <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/real-estate-investors-buy-nft-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article in Blockworks</a> that the team spent seven months solely on legal and compliance preparations.</p><p>According to Valadez, the team faced a challenging choice between quick execution and thorough groundwork. While they knew the idea would be a slam-dunk, they wanted to make sure it could also stand up legally. The platform opted for a more cautious route, focusing on developing the right regulatory structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Homebase partnered with the law firm <a href=\"https://www.huntonak.com/en/people/scott-kimpel.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hunton Andrews Kurth</a> to build a previously non-existent token wrapper that would allow for certain oversight measures. Using the <a href=\"https://www.metaplex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metaplex protocol</a>, the team created the wrapper to modify non-fungible tokens (NFTs), giving Homebase the ability to step in as a third party and freeze, burn and reissue tokens as needed. The wrapper also enforces KYC requirements and a mechanism to escrow funds upon property purchase, with the release of funds contingent upon reaching the crowdsourced funding goal. Finally, the wrapper also encodes a one-year lockup period that would restrict trading within this initial timeframe, designed for compliance with <a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/regulation-d-offerings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Regulation D</a>.</p>"

In the March 2023 sale, for instance, 15 of the 38 buyers created their first Solana wallet specifically for the purchase of the Homebase NFT.</p><p>A fractionalized homeownership solution (and its user experience) therefore has to be as seamless as logging into any familiar website, such as a bank portal. Challenges like gas fee fluctuations and technical challenges in other blockchain ecosystems led Homebase to seek a different option.</p><p>“Bridging from a Layer 2 blockchain is actually quite complex,” Valadez said. “And there's a period of time in which your money just disappears as it’s transitioning from one blockchain to the other.” Not so great for investor confidence.</p><p>Solana emerged as the ideal choice due to its user-friendly interface supporting USDC, which ensured a hassle-free property tokenization process. The suite of tools available within the Solana ecosystem have also provided easy-enough solutions that the Homebase team could walk its early investors through the process.&nbsp;</p><p>“We do all rental distributions in USDC,” Valadez said, adding that the team has partnered with stablecoin issuer <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Circle</a> to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there’s the process of on- and off-ramp. To keep the fiat-to-crypto exchange process all inside the Homebase platform, the team integrated with onboarding solution <a href=\"https://coinflow.cash/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoinFlow</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“We integrated the on-ramps and off-ramps in the same platform,” explained Valadez. “So you as a non-web3 native withdraw your portion of the property’s monthly rent into your bank account when you’re ready.”</p><p>When owners are ready to sell their portion of the property, they can also do that within the Homebase platform.&nbsp; Here, the use of blockchain technology offers significant advantages. With traditional real estate investments among friends, selling involves complex agreements and permissions. In contrast, Homebase employs tokens representing ownership in the property's holding LLC. This means selling doesn't require approval from other LLC members; it's simply facilitated on the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>When an owner does want to buy, Homebase matches sellers with interested buyers, streamlining the process with online documentation via DocuSign, reducing the typical hurdles found in private real estate markets.</p><p>Such ease of use is paramount, says Valadez, who strives to engender confidence in new investors who may not have otherwise considered themselves as players in the real estate game.</p>"
