The new <a href=\"https://solana.org/delegation-criteria\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delegation Program criteria</a> provides time-limited support for a new validator’s voting costs, and provides a delegation from the Foundation based on the amount of external stake a node attracts.
