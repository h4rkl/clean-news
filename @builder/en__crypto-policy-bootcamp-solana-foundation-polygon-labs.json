The day was filled with sessions that covered a range of topics, including the state of play of blockchain policy and the myriad forms that advocacy takes.</p><p>A few key takeaways.</p><p><strong>1. How to be an effective advocate.</strong></p><ul><li>Reach out to your member of Congress (in your District). It’s surprising how few members hear about blockchain from operators and builders in the space.</li><li>Let your expertise shine. Industry stakeholders are reliable sources of expertise. Members of Congress and staff are eager to learn from experts.&nbsp;</li><li>You can be a guide. Consider showcasing how your project works.&nbsp;</li><li>Offer relevant and unbiased information relevant to a state or district. Industry experts have the opportunity to become reliable sources of expertise and can more easily remain engaged in policy as it is developed.</li><li>Not sure who your Member of Congress is? <a href=\"https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find them here</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Storytelling matters.</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to tell your story succinctly and in plain language.</li><li>Be clear. There is a huge knowledge gap, and clarity is key.</li><li>Focus on impact. How specifically does a project have a positive impact that isn’t possible without blockchain?</li><li>Diversify the media where stories appear. Tell stories on social media, op-eds, and blog posts.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Legislation is a process, with some promising first steps.</strong></p><ul><li>Getting a bill passed into law is a long and complicated journey.&nbsp;</li><li>And the U.S. government has numerous bodies that work in both the legislative and regulatory space.</li><li>Two bills recently passed out of Committee (one on market structure and one on stablecoin), which are monumental steps for crypto legislation.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Policy is a doing word: talking, advocating, explaining, teaching. Building relationships, offline and on, to more effectively shape emerging frameworks that can help the industry thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the first bootcamp–an experiment in how members of the blockchain community can work together cross-industry to help people in the space engage in the democratic process. Plans for future bootcamps include sessions outside of Washington, D.C. and open to a wider group of participants.</p>"
