Consensus votes incur standard transaction fees like all other transactions on the network in order to have their result confirmed by the validator set. While individual transactions on Solana are extremely low-cost (a single vote transaction carries a 0.000005 SOL transaction fee), Solana’s short block times of 400ms means that a perfectly performing validator could submit up to 216,000 vote transactions per day, incurring a theoretical upper bound of up to 1.08 SOL in transaction fee costs daily.&nbsp;</p><p>This voting cost can create a financial barrier for some new operators who want to help secure the Solana network. Once a validator has received stake delegations on the network and earns block rewards from transaction fees included in any blocks they produce, these protocol rewards can be used to offset their voting costs.</p><p>To help new or smaller validators overcome this initial barrier, the Foundation will run a time-bound program to partially cover a node’s vote costs with diminishing coverage over time to encourage operators to find their way to self-sufficiency. For new operators on mainnet who choose to apply for voting support, Solana Foundation will now cover:</p><ul><li>100% of voting costs for epochs 0-45</li><li>75% of voting costs for epochs 46-90</li><li>50% of voting costs for epochs 90-135</li><li>25% of voting costs for epochs 136-180</li></ul><p>After 180 epochs (approximately one year), the Foundation will not cover any vote costs for node operators.

For example, if a validator receives 5,000 SOL from external delegations, the Foundation will delegate an additional 5,000 SOL to that node as long as it meets ongoing performance and decentralization criteria. If that validator’s delegation increases over time up to 100,000 SOL, the Foundation will continually increase its matched delegation. When a validator’s external stake exceeds 100,000 SOL, up to 1,000,000 SOL, the Foundation match will remain capped at 100,000 SOL. If a validator’s external delegations exceed 1,000,000 SOL, the Foundation will no longer delegate to that node.</p><p>Any residual SOL held by the Foundation that is committed to this program after all the stake matching delegations are made will be distributed evenly to eligible validators as long as they meet program performance requirements.</p><p>The initial matching ratio of 1:1, matching limits, and the pool of residual SOL delegations are all expected to decrease over time as the Foundation increases its deposits into community stake pools, thereby reducing any operator’s reliance on any single delegation strategy or on the Foundation as a whole.</p>"
