Blinks are currently not geared toward user onboarding, since they lack functionality on mobile or for non-crypto users. But they offer a more composable, seamless experience for crypto apps, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySd66tRY6HU&amp;list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&amp;index=70\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> by Dialect founder Chris Osborn at Breakpoint. Developers can teleport their apps into social media platforms, starting with Twitter, or even other apps. For example, DRiP <a href=\"https://x.com/drip_haus/status/1823890958410228020\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">uses</a> blinks to let users bid on auctions via Mallow and buy NFTs from Tensor directly on DRiP.</p><p>One of the early use cases for blinks has been in e-commerce, with brands like <a href=\"https://x.com/BAXUSco/status/1807856125054013702\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BAXUS</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/KeystoneWallet/status/1813926326652506312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Keystone</a> leveraging blinks for product drops directly on Twitter. At Breakpoint, payments platform Helio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhX-vo1UA2w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it will soon launch blinks for Shopify, making it even easier for Shopify merchants to reach more buyers. Helio <a href=\"https://medium.com/helio-fintech/helio-takes-the-helm-of-solana-pay-on-shopify-8deef50a6014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">took over</a> operations of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/solana-pay-plug-in-with-shopify-for-usdc-payments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana Pay Shopify plugin</a> in December, which has helped drive Helio’s total annualized payment volume to $1 billion, according to co-founder Stijn Paumen at Breakpoint.</p><p>Since the blinks launch at the end of July, hundreds of developers have created over <a href=\"https://dial.to/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">400 unique types of blinks</a>. To spur development, SEND hosted a blinks hackathon (“Blinkathon”), featuring over $30,000 in prizes from SEND and many partner sponsors. After Breakpoint, SEND <a href=\"https://x.com/thesendcoin/status/1839324387935399999\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the results of the Blinkathon, which garnered over 100 submissions.&nbsp;</p><p>The top overall prize went to <a href=\"https://x.com/tj_littlejohn/status/1826679111021916455\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blurt</a>, which allows users to donate to live streamers on Twitch, Youtube, Twitter, and Kick directly via a blink. Streamers can easily start accepting crypto donations creating a wallet with their Google account, powered by <a href=\"https://x.com/TipLinkOfficial/status/1800552077673807946\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TipLink</a>. Blockchain-based payments, especially micropayments, are a notable unlock for the creator economy. To facilitate micropayments, platforms like Twitch and TikTok use in-app currencies, but there’s still inefficiencies: creators have to hit a $50 <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/minimum-payout-threshold?language=en_US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawal</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tiktok-creator-fund-terms/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">threshold</a> and may need to wait up to a month to access their earnings. <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/payout-details-faq?language=en_US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Payout</a> and currency exchange fees also cut into their earnings, especially for creators outside the U.S. By leveraging low-cost payments on Solana, Blurt could boost platform margins while allowing creators to keep more of what they earn.</p><h2><strong>Institutions are Here</strong></h2>"

Token extensions is also a unique blockchain solution that expands the design space for token issuers, especially those who need compliance, without requiring them to build the necessary infrastructure themselves or use permissioned environments.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, a strong payments ecosystem has developed on Solana, with support from traditional companies like Visa, PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe, alongside numerous crypto-native protocols. Breakpoint featured several payments-related developments, including:</p><ul><li>Sling Money’s Open Launch: At Breakpoint, Sling Money <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv_FXzrAHTI&amp;list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&amp;index=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the general availability of its global payments app. The app supports instant fiat on/offramps across 76 countries, integrating various payment rails including bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money accounts like Pix and M-PESA. Users can also load and transfer stablecoins between wallets or exchanges in an additional 75+ countries. In-app payments are powered by Solana-based stablecoins, but this is abstracted away from users who can send money in their preferred currency. Additionally, Sling Links enable users to send money to non-Sling users via a simple link sent through text, email, or other messaging platforms.</li><li>Zar’s Introduction: Zar is a new payments protocol that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwVlnXjm3mY&amp;list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&amp;index=70&amp;pp=iAQB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> itself at Breakpoint. It aims to accelerate stablecoin adoption in emerging markets by improving cash on/offramp infrastructure. It uses DePIN incentives to aggregate and scale existing <a href=\"https://x.com/zarpay_app/status/1838682727169818911\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">agent banking networks</a>, which process $560 billion in cash annually among over 18 million agents. The Zar app functions like a decentralized exchange but for the physical world, allowing users to find agents offering the best rates for converting cash to digital dollars. It features a stablecoin-only wallet that abstracts away crypto complexities, a debit card compatible with Apple and Google Pay, and an SDK for integration into other wallets and apps. Zar is founded by Brandon Timinisky, who previously launched Pakistani mobile neobank SadaPay, which reached four million users within two years before being acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Huma Finance’s Solana Deployment: Payment financing (PayFi) network Huma Finance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW2PcHdWBOs&amp;list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&amp;index=24\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it will be deploying on Solana at Breakpoint. PayFi refers to leveraging the time value of money. In the traditional world, credit cards, trade finance, and cross-border prefunding all rely on a form of PayFi. With low transaction fees, enforceable smart contracts, and cross-border payments on Solana, financing options like accounts receivable and creator monetization can be democratized for all parties.

Fuse recently <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/248985/fuse-plugs-solana-token-energy-distribution-depin-play\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> $12 million in funding, led by Multicoin, to build Project Zero, whose mainnet launch is planned for 2025.</li><li>Starpower: Starpower is a decentralized energy network on Solana that aggregates devices into a decentralized virtual power plant (VPP). Similar to Project Zero, it rewards users for managing and optimizing their energy consumption. Starpower currently sells and distributes three pieces of hardware: a wall plug to connect home devices to the network, a battery for energy storage, and an EV-charging solution. Almost 14,000 devices have been activated on the network, according to the project’s <a href=\"https://www.starpower.world/explorer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explorer</a>.</li><li>Srcful: Srcful is also developing a dVPP, starting with solar panels and home batteries. Instead of building out its own infrastructure layer from scratch, Scrful leverages existing Helium IoT infrastructure as a Helium <a href=\"https://docs.srcful.io/helium-energy/overview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subnetwork</a> (Helium ENERGY). Compatible Helium Hotspots can be upgraded for potential dual mining rewards of both IOT and ENERGY. Srcful is currently in beta on Solana devnet.</li><li>Powerledger: Powerledger offers a platform for tracking, tracing, and trading renewable energy. Powerledger has been building on its own SVM fork for the past two years, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5oaTWea0os&amp;list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&amp;index=106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> at Breakpoint that it is migrating to Solana mainnet. By migrating to mainnet, Powerledger will enable Solana projects and validators to track their energy usage and purchase offsets, while also integrating assets like carbon credits into DeFi.</li><li>DeCharge: DeCharge is a DePIN network for electrical vehicle charging. Users can purchase and install an EV charger, earning when others use it. DeCharge placed second in the Renaissance hackathon’s DePIN track and was accepted into Colosseum’s first accelerator cohort. DeCharge has surpassed 400,000 minutes of EV charging among over 211 locations, according to <a href=\"https://substack.com/@tokenrelations/p-149396576\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Token Relations</a>.</li></ul>"

Traditional CDNs like Cloudfare and Akumai cache content (for e.g., images, videos, and webpages) across distributed servers. When users request content, it’s delivered by the closest server, reducing latency compared to if it was always delivered by the origin server.</p><p>Pipe Network hopes to improve on this model by incentivizing people to contribute their excess storage and bandwidth. The thesis is simple: more nodes = higher chance a node is closer to the user = faster delivery. It plans to launch its mainnet in 2025.</p><p>As a decentralized edge computing layer, Gradient Network is similar to Pipe Network, but it focuses more on dynamic, rather than static, content. It incentivizes users to contribute idle compute resources to perform real-time processing tasks such as AI inference and serverless functions.
