In 2021, he noticed a rise in popularity of games that use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players and provide digital ownership provenance, such as <a href=\"https://nbatopshot.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NBA Top Shot</a>. He predicted (accurately, he’d learn) that there was also a market for skill-based games like horse racing.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought, ‘maybe crypto games are ready,’” he recalled. “And so I started to do a lot of analysis on blockchain.”</p><p>Instantly, he noticed too much friction and fee structures that disincentivized users from taking advantage of blockchain’s power to realistically tokenize digital objects into tradable items with immutable provenance.</p><p>“I thought, ‘This stuff is too clunky,’” said Cummings. \"Who's going to pay $50 to transfer $50 worth of items?” he asked, referencing the often-steep and unpredictable gas (service) fees to make small transactions on the Ethereum network.</p><p>Cummings sought a blockchain solution that was fast, cheap, and trustworthy, essential for a game involving real money transactions. The Solana protocol offered his team the perfect combination of speed, low cost and security — making it the ideal platform for Photo Finish™ LIVE.</p><p>\"When I started to talk with [Solana Foundation], I started to see, ‘Wow, this really could be the unlock that is needed,’” Cummings remembers. His goal was to not just allow users to mint and breed horses onchain, but to also create an open, user-controlled ecosystem for horse racing and real money — something not possible on centralized platforms like Apple and Google, and often too expensive on other blockchain solutions like Ethereum.</p><p>\"Solana's efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical for the seamless experience of live events like the Kentucky Derby in our game,” he added.</p>"

The introduction of <a href=\"https://solana.com/tokenextensions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">token extensions</a>, a next-generation token program, will be crucial for stabilizing the game's internal currency, $DERBY, says Cummings.&nbsp;</p><p>As he describes, using token extensions will ensure that the token is not subject to external market volatility. \"Token extensions are going to be pivotal in maintaining the economic integrity of $DERBY, providing a stable, trustworthy environment for our players,” he told us.</p><p>The introduction of token extensions on the Solana blockchain allows for the locking of the token within the ecosystem of \"Photo Finish™ LIVE.\" This means players cannot take the currency outside the game to trade or speculate, thus maintaining its stability and integrity.</p><p>Finally, token extensions will ensure onchain transparency. Players can see the transactions, understand where their currency is, and trust in the safety of their digital assets. This transparency and trust are crucial in a game where real money horse racing and wagering are central elements.</p><p>\"You can go to a Dune analytics dashboard and see the actual volume of deposits,” Cummings explained. \"You can track every single transaction and watch the growth of our game.

The gaming universe is basically a virtual twin of the real-life Kentucky Derby (designed with permission under official licenses), but at a significantly accelerated pace. In the game’s parallel timezone, one year passes every month, resulting in a monthly Kentucky Derby. Horses age a year each month, and if they need to enter retirement to have offspring, they are out of commission from racing forever, never returning to the track.</p><p>This approach stimulates competition and keeps things interesting, says Cummings. It ensures that new players always have a chance to breed their way to the top, as horses always age out of the racing economy. The game's developers have also created a detailed genetic system, allowing players to have input in the breeding process and subsequent bloodlines. The initial set of horses, bred by players and known affectionately as the “Adam and Eve” pair, formed the genetic foundation for all future bloodlines, evolving organically without developer intervention. The game's genetic and breeding system is therefore quite complex and unpredictable.</p><p>“We almost can’t intervene at this point,” Cummings said. “It's all very <em>Jurassic Park </em>now. Stuff's just going to happen, and we don't really know, and we can't wait to see. Even the way the horses look, the way their coats blend with each other—all of that is genetics.”</p>"
