The Solana Campus, located at TAETs Art and Event Park about 15 minutes from central Amsterdam, is a pop-up space that will make the metaphor of Solana as a city come to life.</p><p>Not only will the Solana Campus feature stages for keynote ideas, builder learnings, and creator success stories, but also activities from ecosystem teams, art events from creators within the Solana community, and places to eat, drink, and mingle with your fellow Breakpoint attendees. And it’ll be easy to get there in style, with free ferries and shuttles that will transport Breakpointers from central Amsterdam directly to campus.</p><p>Interested in hosting an event or sponsoring something on Solana Campus?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://form.typeform.com/to/s5bBaKn1?ref=solana.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reach out here.</a></p><p>This year’s Breakpoint promises to be better than ever.
