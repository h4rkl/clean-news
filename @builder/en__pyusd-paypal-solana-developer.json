Token creators can configure extensions after token creation, but token creators cannot add new extensions. Because of this requirement, several extensions have been initialized for PYUSD, but not all of them may be used.</p><ul><li>Confidential transfers: allows merchants to provide confidentiality for transaction amounts to their consumers while maintaining visibility for regulatory purposes. (Note: This has not yet been enabled on Solana.)</li><li>Transfer hook: allows calling specific programs with each token transfer, enabling fine grained controls over how wallets can interact with the asset. As with transfer fees, this is initialized for potential future use but is currently initialized with a null program ID.</li><li>Permanent delegate: allows specifying a permanent delegate for a mint. This delegate has unlimited delegate privileges over any account for that mint, which means that it can burn or transfer any amount of tokens. This extension is critical for regulatory purposes, as it allows for seizing funds as required for compliance.</li><li>Metadata and metadata pointer: allows token creators to designate an address that describes the canonical (official) metadata for the token. This is used to store the name, ticker, and image in a standard manner.</li><li>Mint close authority: allows owners to close mint accounts and reclaim the <a href=\"https://docs.solana.com/terminology#lamport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lamports</a> on the mint account. Although this may never be needed, it has been initialized in case it is needed in the future.</li></ul><p>Transfer fees: allows transfer fees to be withheld on each transfer, that can be claimed by a defined account. This is included as a fail-safe and initialized to 0.</p>"
