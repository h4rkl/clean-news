Following the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dfuse.io/en/blog/dfuse-open-sources-its-blockchain-development-stack?ref=solana.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>&nbsp;of the open-sourcing of the dfuse blockchain data stack, Solana Foundation is today announcing that it will collaborate with dfuse on the technical integration to provide a powerful data solution for Solana’s high-throughput blockchain.</p><p>dfuse has been building high-throughput blockchain data solutions for the past two years, and is currently deployed on many EOSIO and Ethereum chains, with other protocols under active development. We believe their solution will be critical to enabling a web-scale infrastructure capable of supporting hundreds of public and private deployments, including exchanges, trading operations, interactive games, social media platforms, supply chain solutions, and high throughput regulated environments.</p><p>By collaborating with Solana to integrate with its blockchain, dfuse will be contributing dfuse Search, its real-time, historical and fork-aware search engine as well as many more foundational building blocks to the Solana ecosystem. Enabled by dfuse, developers will not only be able to build high-performance applications on top of a public blockchain that are only possible with the Solana protocol but also deliver the best historical and real-time user experiences.</p><p>“We have decided to collaborate with Solana because of its unique approach at solving many of the challenges encountered in the blockchain space, enabling the protocol to support 50K+ transactions per second at the first layer,” said Alexandre Bourget, co-founder and CTO at dfuse. “By pushing the limits of networks and hardware, they will be a driving force in making our products even more powerful and performant.”</p><p>“We are excited to partner with dfuse as the team is at another level when it comes to serving blockchain data,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, President of the Solana Foundation&nbsp;,“They have a history of shipping non-stop, a very deep understanding of the protocols they integrate, and high standards in terms of reliability, performance and innovation with the data services they bring about. Having dfuse on Solana will tremendously accelerate the onboarding of new projects to Solana.”</p><p>Once integrated, dfuse will be offering Solana developers data services fulfilling the needs of applications to access transaction history, past state and traces of execution, in its beautiful streaming fashion, with the same reliability dfuse customers have become accustomed to.</p><p><strong>About Solana</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://solana.com/?ref=solana.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a>&nbsp;is a high-throughput blockchain that is currently supporting 50–65k transactions per second and 400ms block times, without complex solutions like sharding or layer-two. As the world’s first web-scale blockchain, Solana will unlock a whole new class of performant applications and facilitate larger scale blockchain adoption.
