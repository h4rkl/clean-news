Breakpoint 2024 is going to be a crypto conference unlike any other. And now, the official agenda is here.

There wonâ€™t be any panels or shilling here. The premiere Solana event of the year will be full of thought-provoking debates, game-changing keynotes, and product-focused announcements. See the full agenda.

### Left Curve, For the Culture

There are no secondary stages at Breakpoint this year. The two stages â€” Left Curve and Right Curve â€” will both be chock full of exciting programming.

Left Curve will be the stage focused on product and culture. Hereâ€™s some of the highlights you can look forward to:

-   Kick things off with a conversation between Solana Labs president **Raj Gokal** and the Network Stateâ€™s **Balaji Srinivasan**.
-   Itâ€™s been two years since **Firedancer** was first demoed at Breakpoint 2022. When is it coming to Solana mainnet beta? Kevin Bowers of Jump Crypto will be giving an update.
-   Are celebrity coins good or bad? **Eric Wall** of Taproot Wizards debates with the mother of Solana celeb tokens, **Iggy Azalea.**
-   **Crypto: East vs. West!** Join a rousing debate on the strengths and differences in the blockchain world with Cindy Leow of Drift, Joanna Zeng of SOON, and Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures.
-   **Should the Solana Foundation exist at all, or should it be dissolved?** Joel John of Decetralised hosts a lively debate between Dan Albert of the Solana Foundation and Viktor Fischer of RockawayX.
-   **Is Solana more future-proof than Ethereum, or will the Solana ecosystem need more L2s before it becomes more competitive?** Santiago Roel Santos of the SRS Family Office dukes it out with Avichal Garg of Electric Capital in a debate hosted by Ben Sparango of the Solana Foundation.
-   Biohacker and VC extraordinaire **Bryan Johnson** of Blueprint comes on stage for an illuminating fireside chat.
-   What can be done about scams and rugs? **Emily Meyers** of Electric Capital and **Mike Dudas** of 6th Man Ventures debate it out with moderator **Logan Jastremski** of Frictionless Capital.
-   Stay to the end of Day 1 for a special event â€” the Solana Awards ðŸ‘€

<h3>Gigabrain on Right Curve</h3><p>Right Curve will be a stage focused on developers and engineering. Donâ€™t expect things to be simplified here â€” itâ€™s the home of the technical deep dives, workshops, and mind-melding demos.</p><p>Hereâ€™s a sample of what you can expect:</p><ul><li><strong>How do you automatic market makers fight off sandwich attacks?</strong> Eugene Chen of Ellipsis Labs will give a technical deep dive.</li><li><strong>zk compression</strong> is here! Swen Schaeferjohann of Light Protocol and Nicolas Pennie of Helius host a session on zero knowledge compression indexing.</li><li><span style="color: var(--text-regular);">Dig into </span><strong style="color: var(--text-regular);">blinks and Solana Actions</strong><span style="color: var(--text-regular);"> with a technical workshop hosted by the Solana Foundation's Nick Frostbutter.</span></li><li><span style="color: var(--text-regular);">What roadmap could Solana take, and what could Solana 2.0 be? </span><strong style="color: var(--text-regular);">Mert Mumtaz of Helius</strong><span style="color: var(--text-regular);"> hosts a fireside chat with Solana Labsâ€™ </span><strong style="color: var(--text-regular);">Anatoly Yakovenko.</strong><span style="color: var(--text-regular);">&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

### Go Beyond the Stages

Breakpoint isnâ€™t just about what happens on the Left and Right Curves. There will be plenty of content that happens off the agenda that will be hosted by the community.

-   **The Pod,** a learning space, will host more intimate workshops and talks from teams across the Solana ecosystem.
-   **The Colosseum Hackathon Arena,** a special buildspace for those participating in the Solana Radar Hackathon, will host a series of workshops, to be announced by [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/breakpoint) soon.
-   **The PayPal USD Learning Pod** will host developer talks about stablecoins and the future of payments in crypto.
-   The Breakpoint floor will be full of **activations, events, and more crypto-powered features** from teams at the cutting edge of the Solana ecosystem.

You'll be able to find all this information and more in the **official Breakpoint 2024 app!** It's your guide to everything at Breakpoint this year â€” save your favorite events, get reminders, navigate the floor, find the WiFi info, and more. Ticket holders will get an email with app information starting in the next few days.
