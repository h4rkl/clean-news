-   The Neodyme Security Stage — a full day of programming dedicated to building more secure, robust systems.
-   Experiential activations and immersive experiences by artists and teams in the Solana ecosystem.
-   A Community Basecamp with lounges, activations, and events from teams across the Solana ecosystem offering attendees the chance to connect with their favorite communities.
