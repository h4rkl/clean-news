After numerous phases of development, adoption, and rollout, compressed NFTs are live on Solana’s mainnet-beta and powering the next wave of novel on-chain product experiences. Compressed NFTs are 2,400-24,000x cheaper than their uncompressed counterparts, while still retaining identical structures. Now minting 100 million NFTs on Solana costs only ◎50!

For the developers who want to get started with compressed NFTs, there are five key things to know:

1.  [Understand Merkle trees](https://solana.com/news/how-to-use-compressed-nfts-on-solana#understand-merkle-trees)
2.  [Initialize the tree](https://solana.com/news/how-to-use-compressed-nfts-on-solana#initialize-tree)
3.  [Mint an NFT](https://solana.com/news/how-to-use-compressed-nfts-on-solana#mint-an-nft)
4.  [Use an RPC to get the latest data](https://solana.com/news/how-to-use-compressed-nfts-on-solana#rpc)
5.  [Use proofs to transfer NFTs](https://solana.com/news/how-to-use-compressed-nfts-on-solana#proofs)

## Understand Merkle trees

State compression takes advantage of Merkle trees, a data structure known for its capability to “compress” the verifiability of a tree of data into a “hash,” or “fingerprint,” of the current state of the tree. The Merkle roots are stored on-chain and updates are stored directly in the Solana ledger, meaning anyone can verifiably (and permissionlessly) reconstruct the tree, combining a vast amount of verifiable off-chain storage with a low overall cost of on-chain storage.

Engineers at Solana Labs added the capability to concurrently update Merkle trees multiple times in the same block by allowing the fast-forwarding of stale proofs. This capability is unique to Solana. [See more in the whitepaper.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BOpa5OFmara50fTvL0VIVYjtg-qzHCVc/view)

<h2>Initialize the tree</h2>
<p>
  The first thing you need to do is initialize the Merkle tree. There are three
  parameters to any Merkle tree: 1) Depth (capacity), 2) buffer size
  (concurrency / latency), and 3) canopy height (composability).
</p>
<p>
  Depth is easy —t he capacity of a perfectly balanced concurrent Merkle tree is{" "}
  <code>2^{DEPTH}, </code>and trees can be configured to hold anywhere from
  eight leaves all the way up to a billion (2^30). In this case, leaves can be
  NFTs.
</p>
<p>
  Buffer size is an approximation of the number of concurrent updates that can
  happen in the same block. Merkle trees typically have an issue whereby any
  modification of the tree causes any previously computed proofs to go
  out-of-date, but with this novel concurrent Merkle tree implementation, stale
  proofs can be fast-forwarded and still be accepted by the smart contract. A
  buffer size of 64 means that any given proof will still remain valid for up to
  64 updates of the tree, after which it must be recomputed. Buffer size can be
  anywhere from eight to 2048.
</p>
<p>
  Canopy height specifies the portion of the tree that remains on-chain,
  reducing the amount of proofs that have to be submitted by clients for
  verification. Given the current transaction size limits on Solana, this is the
  only feasible way to pass enough proofs to be able to validate the existence
  of trees with a depth &gt; 20. Canopy height maxes out at 17.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than initialize one giant tree to hold everything, I recommend issuing
  numerous, smaller trees of varying sizes. This reduces write-lock contention
  on the tree account, as well as provides more opportunities for composability
  by reducing the number of proofs needed to be submitted for any given
  modification.
</p>
<p>
  Choose a canopy height that maximizes composability — while it costs more in
  rent, a canopy height that is DEPTH-3 provides a similar interface to existing
  NFT-related smart contracts that already pass 3 accounts. For example, a tree
  of depth 20 could have a canopy of 17 so that clients only need to submit
  three proofs to make any modification to a tree.
</p>

## Mint an NFT

Tooling for minting compressed NFTs is already live. [Bubblegum](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/bubblegum/program), the smart contract written by Metaplex that powers compressed NFTs, uses state compression under the hood. Mint, transfer, and replace instructions should be issued against the Bubblegum smart contract. Mints do not require proofs, so anyone can mint compressed NFTs as easily as before.

## Use an RPC to get the latest data

Compressed NFTs eschew the typical on-chain account approach, and because data related to trees is being issued into the Solana ledger, RPCs are required to make the “read” experience nice and snappy. [Helius](https://helius.xyz/), [SimpleHash](https://simplehash.com/), and [Triton](https://triton.one/#/) all have support for compressed NFTs, and 2/3 implement the Metaplex Read API—a uniform interface for retrieving all the information necessary about both compressed and uncompressed NFTs.

<h2>Use proofs to transfer NFTs</h2>
<p>
  Because of how compressed NFTs are stored, any modifications to those NFTs
  (such as an ownership change, or an update to the metadata like the collection
  information) requires a modification of the storage tree itself. In order to
  do so, one must compute the <em>proofs</em> needed to signify that you know
  the latest state of the tree, along with the signature of the leaf owner (or
  delegate).
</p>
<p>
  Merkle tree proofs are the set of hashes that can be used to prove that the
  leaf was in the tree to begin with.RPC nodes can provide this with the{" "}
  <code>`getAssetProof` </code>Read API RPC method. Depending on the canopy
  height of the tree, one can submit a subset of the proof path and let the
  on-chain program handle reconciling the rest of it.
</p>
<p>
  Submit the proofs along with the modification you want to make (a new owner!)
  and send the transaction. Voila!
</p>
<p>
  Once you’ve understood these concepts, you should be ready to take advantage
  of compressed NFTs and build brand new experiences.
