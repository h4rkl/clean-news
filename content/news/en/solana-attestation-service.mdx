Onboarding users to Solana just got easier. Today, the Solana Identity Group, alongside the Solana Foundation, is announcing **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)** is now live on Solana mainnet — an open, permissionless protocol for verifiable credentials. The SAS allows trusted issuers to associate off-chain information (such as KYC checks, geographic eligibility, membership in a clip, or accreditation status) with a user’s wallet. These attestations are signed, verifiable, and reusable across applications without exposing sensitive data onchain or duplicating verification steps.

By providing a neutral and permissionless attestation layer, SAS enables compliance, access control, reputation systems, and programmable identity across the Solana ecosystem. It’s a better, easier experience for both end users and builders.

## **SAS: The Trust Layer for Internet Capital Markets**

As internet capital markets on Solana grow, applications must be able to verify offchain data — such as compliance status, user uniqueness, or jurisdiction — at scale and without friction.

Today, each application often builds its own verification flows, manages sensitive user data, or relies on siloed integrations. This increases user friction, regulatory risk, and operational overhead.

The Solana Attestation Service changes that dynamic by providing:

-   **Portable credentials** that users can hold within their wallet and reuse across applications.
-   **Neutral, open infrastructure** that issuers, developers, and users can rely on without centralized gatekeepers.
-   **Programmable trust** that applications can access with one SDK call — without needing to manage backends or identity databases.

SAS is designed to be secure by design, private by default, and composable for a wide range of blockchain use cases.

This is only a small snapshot of what’s possible. With SAS, you can attest to anything — and developers can focus on building better user experiences while relying on the open SAS standard.

## **The Solana Identity Group**

The SAS is the first project from the newly formed Solana Identity Group, a collection of teams across the Solana ecosystem. This group will be focused on building, testing, and implementing new identity primitives and specs that can be implemented by any Solana-based team.

The Solana Identity Group is:

-   **Civic**, a leading identity management solution for the verifiable Internet, empowering people to privately manage their identities across chains with an onchain representation of their reusable identity.
-   **Solid**, a global standard for digital identity and data self sovereignty. Verify Once. Use Anywhere.
-   **Solana.ID**, an onchain reputation product that helps you to get perks from every corner of the Solana ecosystem. 
-   **Solana Foundation**, a Swiss nonprofit dedicated to the security, development, and growth of the greater Solana ecosystem.
-   **Trusta Labs**, Matching onchain assets with the right users using AI powered sybil prevention, knowledge graph enhanced profiling, and user targeting.

If you are part of an identity-focused project that would benefit from building open source public solutions, please reach out to identity@solana.org.

## **Start Building with SAS**

**Solana Attestation Service is available today on Solana mainnet. Start building now!**

-   Check out the [official website](https://attest.solana.com) for example documentation, use cases, and schemas

<h2><strong>Teams Building with SAS </strong></h2><h3><strong>Solid</strong></h3><p><strong>Solid integrates Solana's attestation service to enable decentralized identity and data ownership for users. By minting a “Priority Pass,” users create a unique digital identity linked to their Solana wallet. Verified credentials—such as KYC data or social profiles—are stored on-chain as attestations. Users can selectively share this data with third parties and earn tokens as rewards, incentivizing participation. Reputation scores are built from these attestations and can be enhanced through staking. This integration empowers users with privacy-preserving, transparent, and monetizable control over their identity in the Solana ecosystem.</strong></p><h3><strong>Solana ID</strong></h3><p><strong>Solana ID helps you to get perks from every corner of the Solana ecosystem. Become a holder </strong><a href="https://app.solana.id" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a><strong>!</strong></p><p><strong>In addition to this, we are now integrating and utilizing Solana Attestation Service to issue career attestations and verify your work and position.
