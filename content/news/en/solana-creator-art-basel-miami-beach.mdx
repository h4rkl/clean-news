The Solana community is still buzzing from its debut at [Art Basel Miami Beach](https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach), the leading international art fair, which took place Dec. 6-10, 2023. The Solana exhibition, entitled _Artists in Residence_, not only showcased the diverse creativity of Solana artists from around the globe, but also engaged attendees with  the chance to meet artists in person, as well as with interactive experiences supported by teams within the Solana ecosystem. For many attendees, including collectors and artists from the traditional art world, this was their first experience interacting with blockchain technology and learning how it can support artists. 

Over the course of the five-day show, over 3000 attendees made their way through the exhibition and experienced how Solana’s capabilities enhance ownership, earning, audience engagement, and more, for artists of all kinds. [Learn more](https://solana.com/art-basel).

## An unforgettable experience powered by Solana teams

Attendees who visited the _Artists in Residence_ exhibition were invited to engage with Solana-powered products, art-exchange platforms, and curated creator experiences throughout the event. Here’s a look at the various teams that helped enrich the Solana exhibition at Art Basel:

-   [Meural](https://my.meural.netgear.com/), powered by NetGear, provided the screens in the exhibition, which allowed even the smallest detail of each showcased work to be seen in clear, high definition.
-   [Primitives](https://primitives.xyz/landing?redirectTo=%2Fhome) showed attendees how to easily mint,collect, and start building their digital galleries on Solana at a dedicated on-screen minting station within the exhibition with easy-to-follow steps for getting started.
-   [Sleek](https://www.sosleek.io/) provided a custom NFC card with a curated selection of resources to help artists and creatives get started on Solana.
-   [TipLink](https://tiplink.io/) powered an experience that enabled attendees to claim limited edition artworks onsite from artists Lisanne Haack, Eko33, and Sleepr. 

The exhibition was curated in collaboration with the teams from [Primitives](https://primitives.xyz/home), [Collector](https://collector.sh/), [Pengu Love](https://www.pengulove.com/), and input from the broader Solana community. For audiences not onsite at Art Basel, the team at [3.land](https://3.land/) built [a virtual representation](https://3.land/world/9RidDab8FHCfTLVSkXadKpQ5JMnenqx6EJBw5eRZPc6Q) of the _Artists in Residence_ exhibition in the metaverse for anyone to get a glimpse of the experience.

The experiences powered by Solana teams resulted in 400+ new Solana wallets opened, 750+ pieces of artwork claimed, and 200+ new pieces minted onchain over the course of the event.

## Solana artists create masterpieces live at Art Basel
