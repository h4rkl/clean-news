## The Future of the Solana Network

In a pivotal moment for the ecosystem, Dan Albert, Executive Director of the Solana Foundation, [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X1Vk8XQ6OQ&list=PLilwLeBwGuK7Wv9H90ig5SpnT4ipOyFST&index=2) that the long-awaited validator client, Firedancer, is live on testnet. Firedancer will increase validator diversity on Solana, which is the key to long-term resiliency and decentralization. Firedancer is built by a team at Jump Trading Group.

Albert joined Diego Perez de Ayala, Managing Partner at Frictionless Capital, for a [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ngjDiEIPSs&list=PLilwLeBwGuK7Wv9H90ig5SpnT4ipOyFST&index=8) discussing the past, present, and future of Solana. Together, they outlined their prediction of a new era for the network – Solana 2.0, which is “defined by a sense of community ownership”.

## A Truly Onchain Event

Those at Breakpoint 2023 saw this go from an event _about_ blockchain to an event being _run on_ the blockchain. A number of ecosystem projects helped us to make this a reality.

-   **Solana-Powered USDC Payments:** Using [Helio](https://www.hel.io/), attendees could purchase their tickets with USDC, showcasing payments that use the Solana network. 
-   **Solana Pay-Enabled Vending Machines:** [Selecta](https://www.selecta.com/nl/nl) smart fridges integrated Solana Pay, and [Venta](https://www.venta.xyz/) enabled Solana Pay transactions to happen, just by tapping a near-field communication (NFC) wristband.
-   **Official Proof-of-Attendance NFTs:** Collaborating with artists Joyce Liu and Duke +1, the Breakpoint team enabled official Breakpoint POAPs as digital mementos of attendance. 
-   **Blockchain-Based Graphics Rendering:** Some of the graphics used on site were powered by [Render Network](https://rendernetwork.com/) directly on the blockchain.

## From Amsterdam to Singapore!

In addition to all of the above, we topped off the week with a live announcement of Breakpoint 2024, which will take place in Singapore from Sept. 19 to 21. See you there!
