Breakpoint 2024 will take place from September 20-21 at Suntec Singapore, in the heart of Singapore’s Central Business District. The two-day event will include keynote talks, group panel discussions, workshops, in-person experiences, and demonstrations that will address the most pressing issues in the crypto industry.

“Singapore, and the broader Asia Pacific region, is a vibrant epicenter of the blockchain industry” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. “We are excited to bring Breakpoint to APAC for the first time to highlight our builders, specifically from the APAC region and around the world, and to showcase experiences unique to Solana’s global community.”

Projects building on Solana are not only keeping pace with change, they are leading the charge.
